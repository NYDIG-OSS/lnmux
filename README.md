# Lightning Multiplexer

This repository contains the code for the `lnmux` service. The problem that `lnmux` solves is fail-over for incoming Lightning payments. BOLT11 invoices are bound to a single node. If that node goes down, the invoice is no longer payable. The same is true for the node or its peers running out of inbound liquidity.

What `lnmux` allows you to do is set up a cluster of nodes where each of these nodes can settle any invoice. If a node is unable to accept payments for one of the reasons above, senders will still be able to pay the invoice via one of the other nodes.

Even with all nodes in the cluster available, it can be advantageous for the sender to have multiple routing options to better utilize liquidity and minimise fees. If needed, multi-part payments can be completed through more than one cluster node.

## Running

For the setup, it is assumed that there are multiple LND nodes running with connections to the wider Lightning network and sufficient inbound liquidity. The minimally required version of lnd is v0.15.0-beta.

* Run the `lnd` nodes with the `--requireinterceptor` option. This ensures that
  HTLCs are always offered to interceptor applications eventually, even when
  there are momentary disconnects. Not running with this option can lead to
  HTLCs failing after the invoice that they pay to has been marked as settled. 

* Create a postgres database. Note that `lnmux` uses stateless invoices. This means that the database only contains settled invoices.

* Create a config file for `lnmuxd` named `lnmux.yml`. An [example](lnmux.yml.example) can be found in this repository. The config file contains the following elements:
  * LND nodes configuration: TLS certificate, macaroon, address and pubkey. Pubkey is configured as a protection against unintentionally connecting to the wrong node.
  * Postgres connection string for the database created above.
  * 32-byte Identity PRIVATE key. This key is used to generate invoices and decode incoming htlcs. In a production environment, this key must be protected carefully.

* Initialize the database: `go run ./cmd/lnmuxd -c lnmux.yml migrate init`

* Migrate the database to the latest version: `go run ./cmd/lnmuxd -c lnmux.yml migrate up`

* Run `lnmuxd`: `go run ./cmd/lnmuxd -c lnmux.yml run`. This opens connections to all LND nodes via the HTLC interceptor API. Incoming htlcs are collected and assembled into sets. When a set is complete, an external application connected to `lnmux` decides whether to settle the invoice. If the application sends a settle request, the invoice is marked as settled in the `lnmux` database and a settle action is returned to the LND instance(s) holding the HTLC(s).

* Invoice generation is taken over by `lnmuxd`. It is no longer a responsibility of the LND nodes. To generate an invoice, run:

  `grpcurl -plaintext -v -d '{"amt_msat":20000, "expiry_secs":600}' localhost:19090 lnmux.Service.AddInvoice`. 
  
   If you decode the invoice, you'll find route hints from each node in the cluster to the `lnmuxd` public key. `lnmuxd` acts as a virtual node without real channels.

   The invoice is not stored in the `lnmux` database and does not take up any disk space. This makes `lnmux` particularly suitable for scenarios where large numbers of invoices are generated.

  Below is an example invoice generated by `lnmuxd`.

* It should be possible to pay this invoice as long as at least one node in the cluster is available.

* When the payment comes in, an event is generated. Events can be listened for via:
  
  `grpcurl -plaintext -v -d '{"hash":"EgR0u/TAjFXNGId9PEHVnryFl1sy/UwB2uN+YxC8S80="}' localhost:19090 lnmux.Service.SubscribeSingleInvoice`

  (replace base64 hash)

* To request settlement of the invoice, invoke:

  `grpcurl -plaintext -v -d '{"hash":"EgR0u/TAjFXNGId9PEHVnryFl1sy/UwB2uN+YxC8S80="}' localhost:19090 lnmux.Service.SettleInvoice`

## Expected output

If you've set up `lnmuxd` correctly, output similar to what is shown below is expected.
* Interception is started on all of your nodes
* When an HTLC comes in, it is matched against the invoice database. If there is a match, the invoice is loaded into memory.
* The total amount of the HTLC set is tracked. When the total amount matches the invoice amount, HTLC settle resolutions are sent to LND.

## Invoice lifecycle

![](invoice_lifecycle.png)

Note that only the states `accepted`, `settle requested` and `settled` are published to callers of the `SubscribeSingleInvoice` rpc.

The transition from `settle requested` to `settled` is marked as `[future]`. This transition is happening already, but not backed by an actual final settle event from lnd. See https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/6208.

## Regtest testing

The minimal setup to test on regtest is to create three LND nodes A, B and C. Create channels between B and A and between B and C. Connect `lnmuxd` to the nodes A and C. Pay invoices from node B, while experimenting with online status and liquidity of A and C.

## Experimental

This software is in an experimental state. At this stage, breaking changes can happen and may not always include a database migration. Use at your own risk.
